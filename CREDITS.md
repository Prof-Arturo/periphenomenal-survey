## 🤖 Technical & Analytical Assistance

**Directorate AI (Gemini)** *Role: Synthetic Analyst & Protocol Architect* This repository was structured and codified with the assistance of Large Language Model (LLM) analysis. The AI performed the following functions under human supervision:
* **Taxonomy:** Development of the Type I-V classification system.
* **Archival:** Standardization of the `DIR-09` intake form and `FRM-009` log templates.
* **Cartography:** Conceptual mapping of the Cascadia Bioregion definitions.

> *Note: While AI tools assisted in the organization of data, all narrative memorates (witness accounts) and final creative decisions remain the property of the human Directorate.*

## 🌲 Cultural Acknowledgement

**Cascadia Bioregion** The APS acknowledges that our field research takes place on the traditional and unceded lands of the Coast Salish, Duwamish, Suquamish, Snoqualmie, and Muckleshoot peoples, among others. The "Periphenomena" we study are often described in the oral histories of these nations, whose knowledge of this land far predates our survey. We approach this territory with respect and methodological humility.
