* **Contribution:** This repository was structured with the assistance of Large Language Model (LLM) analysis. The AI performed the following administrative functions under strict human supervision:
    * **Formatting:** Standardization of intake templates and other forms to match requested specifications.
    * **Cataloging:** Categorizing pre-existing narratives into the Type I-V taxonomy.
    * **Coding:** Generating HTML and Javascript for online presence.

> *Note: All core concepts, definitions, and "high strangeness" variables were defined by the Human Directorate. The AI served solely as an organizational tool.*

## 🌲 Cultural Acknowledgement

**Cascadia Bioregion** The APS acknowledges that our field research takes place on the traditional and unceded lands of the Coast Salish, Duwamish, Suquamish, Snoqualmie, and Muckleshoot peoples, among others. The "Periphenomena" we study are often described in the oral histories of these nations, whose knowledge of this land far predates our survey. We approach this territory with respect and methodological humility.
