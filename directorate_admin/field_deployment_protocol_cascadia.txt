=========================================================================
APS FIELD DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL: CASCADIA DIVISION (Reg. 10)
Operation: SIGNAL_FLARE (Passive Recruitment)
Status: ACTIVE
=========================================================================

1. OBJECTIVE
------------
To distribute physical access points (QR Code Flyers) in high-probability 
zones for anomalous experience, without compromising researcher anonymity 
or safety.

2. TARGET ZONES (PRIORITY MATRIX)
---------------------------------
[A] COMMUNITY HUBS (High Traffic / Low Strangeness)
    * Context: Coffee shops, libraries, community center bulletin boards.
    * Goal: Capture the "Normal" witness who experienced something weird 
      but has no outlet.
    * Method: Use tape/thumbtacks. MUST be authorized/legal placement.

[B] LIMINAL THRESHOLDS (Medium Traffic / High Strangeness)
    * Context: Trailheads, ferry terminals, rural gas stations, 
      rest stops along Hwy 101 or I-5.
    * Goal: Capture transients and outdoor recreationists.
    * Method: Zip-ties on poles or staples on wooden utility poles 
      (where local ordinance permits).

[C] "HOT SPOTS" (Low Traffic / High Strangeness)
    * Context: Specific locations with folklore history (e.g., Ape Canyon, 
      Port Gamble, Bradshaw Road).
    * Goal: Verify active phenomena.
    * Method: Non-destructive placement only. Do not litter.

3. DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURE (THE "TAG & LOG" LOOP)
----------------------------------------------
For every flyer placed, the Researcher must perform the "Tag & Log":

   STEP 1: FIXATION
   Secure the flyer. Ensure it is flat, visible, and the QR code is 
   not wrinkled (wrinkles break the scan).

   STEP 2: VALIDATION
   Open your own phone camera. Scan the flyer YOU just placed.
   * IF it loads the form: Asset is Live.
   * IF it fails: Replace the flyer immediately.

   STEP 3: LOGGING (The Shadow Record)
   Take a wide-shot photo of the placement for the internal archive.
   * Note the location coordinates (Screensot your compass app or 
     metadata on the photo).
   * Save to: /field_data/deployments/[YYYY-MM-DD]_Location.jpg

4. SAFETY PROTOCOLS (SOLO OPS)
------------------------------
   * THE GRAY MAN DOCTRINE: Wear nondescript clothing. Do not wear 
     tactical gear or costumes. You are an academic surveyor, not a 
     ghost hunter. Look boring.
   * DAYLIGHT ONLY: Do not deploy in remote woodlands after dusk.
   * COMMS CHECK: If entering a dead zone (No Service), text your 
     "Lifeline" contact your coordinates and expected return time 
     BEFORE you lose signal.
   * EGRESS: Park your vehicle nose-out. Know your exit route.

5. LEGAL DISCLAIMER
-------------------
The APS mandates compliance with all local laws regarding signage. 
Do not deface public property. Use designated bulletin boards 
whenever possible. If asked to leave, leave immediately.
