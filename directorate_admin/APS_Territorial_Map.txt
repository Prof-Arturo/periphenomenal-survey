APS TERRITORIAL DESIGNATIONS: NORTH AMERICA (v2.1)
Framework: Bioregional Integrity
Status: EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY
=========================================================================

1. FRAMEWORK
-----------
The American Periphenomenal Survey (APS) rejects political boundaries (State/Provincial lines) 
as the primary delineator of investigation. Anomalous phenomena—cryptids, weather events, 
and folklore—are bound by ecology, geology, and watershed, not legislation.

Therefore, the APS divides the continent into 10 Administrative Units based on 
bioregional and cultural coherence.

3. OPERATIONAL NOTE ON BORDERS
------------------------------
Field Researchers are authorized to cross state and national lines (e.g., WA to BC) 
if the investigation follows a contiguous watershed or mountain range.
The anomaly dictates the jurisdiction, not the map.
