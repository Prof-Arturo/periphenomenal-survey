APS TECHNICAL GUIDE: DIGITAL LAUNCH & SEO
Unit: Cascadia (Region 10)
Reference: Supports 'Phase 1' of Deployment Protocol
=========================================================================

PHASE 1: SERVER ACTIVATION (GITHUB PAGES)
-----------------------------------------
Your files currently sit dormant in the repository.
This step turns them into a live, accessible website.

1. ACCESS REPOSITORY SETTINGS
   - Go to your GitHub Repository.
   - Click the "Settings" tab (Gear icon).
   - Scroll down on the left sidebar to "Pages".

2. CONFIGURE SOURCE
   - Under "Source", ensure "Deploy from a branch" is selected.
   - Under "Branch", select "main" (or master).
   - **CRITICAL STEP:** Select the folder "/aps_online" (NOT root).
   *Why: We only want the public to see the website, not your internal admin files.*

3. LAUNCH
   - Click "Save".
   - Wait approx. 60 seconds. Refresh the page.
   - You will see a banner: "Your site is live at https://[user].github.io/aps_project/"

4. VERIFICATION
   - Open the link on a mobile device.
   - Verify the Cascadia Logo loads.
   - Verify the "Jurisdiction" dropdown shows "Alaska (Southeast)" and "Northern CA".

PHASE 2: SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)
-----------------------------------------
To ensure discovery, search engines must index the site correctly.
We inject "Meta Tags" into the code to define the project scope.

1. OPEN 'index.html'
   - Locate the <head> section (near the top).
   - Paste the following block immediately after the <title> tag:

   <meta name="description" content="The American Periphenomenal Survey (Cascadia Division) is an independent research initiative systematically documenting anomalous human experiences in the Pacific Northwest.">
   <meta name="keywords" content="Cascadia, Bioregion, Bigfoot, Sasquatch, High Strangeness, Liminal Spaces, Glitch in the Matrix, Citizen Science, Pacific Northwest, Region 10">
   <meta name="author" content="APS Research Collective: Cascadia">
   <meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
   
   <meta property="og:type" content="website">
   <meta property="og:title" content="APS Cascadia: Report an Anomaly">
   <meta property="og:description" content="Secure, anonymous reporting for unexplained phenomena in the Pacific Northwest. Help us map the unknown.">
   <meta property="og:image" content="media/aps_cascadia_logo.svg">

PHASE 3: INDEXING (GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE)
-----------------------------------------
Google can take months to find a new GitHub site.
Force the crawl manually.

1. REGISTER
   - Go to Google Search Console (search.google.com/search-console).
   - Log in with a generic Google Account.

2. ADD PROPERTY
   - Select "URL Prefix".
   - Paste your GitHub URL: https://[user].github.io/aps_project/

3. VERIFY OWNERSHIP
   - Google will ask you to prove you own the site.
   - Method: "HTML Tag" (Easiest for GitHub).
   - Copy the meta tag they provide.
   - Paste it into your 'index.html' <head> section.
   - Commit the change to GitHub.
   - Click "Verify" in the Google Console.

4. FORCE CRAWL
   - Once verified, use the "URL Inspection" tool at the top.
   - Paste your URL again.
   - Click "Request Indexing".


PHASE 4: PROFESSIONAL CREDIBILITY (CUSTOM DOMAIN)
-------------------------------------------------
A ".github.io" URL looks like a student project.
A ".org" URL establishes institutional credibility.
*This step is optional but recommended.*

1. ACQUISITION
   - Purchase a domain (approx. $12/yr).
   - Recommended Formats:
     * aps-cascadia.org
     * cascadia-registry.org
     * region10-survey.com

2. LINKING
   - In GitHub Settings > Pages > Custom Domain: Type your new domain.
   - GitHub will provide DNS records (A Records and CNAME).
   - Log into your Domain Registrar and paste these records.
   - Check the box "Enforce HTTPS" in GitHub (Wait 24 hours for SSL certificate).

PHASE 5: COMPLIANCE CHECK
-------------------------
1. PRIVACY LINK
   - Ensure 'privacy.html' exists in the /aps_online/ folder.
   - Verify the link in the footer of 'index.html' works.
