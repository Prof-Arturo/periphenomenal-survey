=========================================================================
APS DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL: CASCADIA DIVISION (v2.0)
Status: ACTIVE | Model: Solo-Operator Franchise
=========================================================================

1. MISSION PROFILE
------------------
The Cascadia Division (Region 10) operates as a decentralized archival node. 
Unlike previous "Ghost Hunting" groups, our goal is not to prove the existence 
of the paranormal, but to map the human experience of it.

We observe Methodological Agnosticism. We document the "Data of the Weird" 
without endorsing a specific spiritual or scientific theory.


2. OPERATIONAL ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------
The Division is organized into four distinct asset directories:

A. /directorate_admin/
   The "Governance" layer. Contains your mandate, protocols, and source files.
   
B. /registry_data/
   The "Archive" layer. Contains the CSV database and the dictionaries 
   required to interpret it.
   
C. /field_kits/
   The "Acquisition" layer. Contains the physical tools (flyers, forms) 
   used to capture data in the real world.
   
D. /aps_online/
   The "Public Interface." The GitHub-hosted website where subjects submit reports.


3. DEPLOYMENT STEPS (INITIALIZATION)
------------------------------------
[ ] STEP 1: ASSET VERIFICATION
    Ensure all files in /field_kits/ and /aps_online/media/ are using the 
    Region 10 "Cascadia" branding (Green/Cream Palette).

[ ] STEP 2: DIGITAL LAUNCH
    Upload the contents of /aps_online/ to your GitHub Repository.
    Verify the "Google Apps Script" is active and writing to "APS_Cascadia_Log.csv".
    Test the form with a dummy entry (ID: TEST-001).

[ ] STEP 3: PASSIVE RECRUITMENT (THE "SPIDERWEB")
    Print 20 copies of "APS_Recruitment_Flyer.pdf".
    Place them in high-traffic "Liminal Spaces" (ferry terminals, trailheads, 
    bulletin boards near older forests).
    The Goal: Let the QR Code do the work.


4. FIELD PROTOCOLS (ACTIVE)
---------------------------
When the Researcher is physically present for an investigation:

A. THE INTERCEPT
   Use "APS_Field_Instrument_Reg10.pdf" (Clipboard).
   ALWAYS fill out Section A (Site Data) before engaging the subject.
   
B. THE BRIDGE
   If the subject is comfortable, hand them the Tablet/Phone with "index.html" loaded.
   Instruct them to fill it out while you record "Subject Observation" notes.
   
C. THE SYNCHRONIZATION
   CRITICAL: Record the exact minute they hit "Submit" on your Clipboard form.
   This timestamps the link between their Digital Narrative and your Analog Verification.

D. THE EXIT
   Always read "APS_Debriefing_Protocol.pdf" to ground the subject.
   Always provide "APS_Resource_Card_Cascadia.pdf".


5. ANALYST WORKFLOW (WEEKLY TRIAGE)
-----------------------------------
Every Sunday, the Director assumes the role of "Senior Analyst."

[ ] STEP 1: INGESTION
    Open "APS_Cascadia_Log.csv" (or the Google Sheet).
    Check for new entries from the QR Code flyers.

[ ] STEP 2: CLEANING
    Fix simple formatting errors (e.g., "Washington" -> "WA").
    Assign a unique "CAS-####" ID to any new rows.

[ ] STEP 3: CODING
    Use "APS_Master_Data_Dictionary.pdf" and "APS_Master_Coding_Sheet.pdf".
    Fill in the Analyst Columns:
    - class_code (e.g., TYPE_B)
    - narr_consistency (1-5)
    - impact_score (1-4)

[ ] STEP 4: ARCHIVAL
    Save the CSV.
    If a narrative is particularly compelling, export it as a "Case File" PDF 
    to the /registry_data/library/ folder.


6. EMERGENCY / SHUTDOWN
-----------------------
In the event of compromise or project termination:
1. Unpublish the GitHub Repository.
2. Archive "APS_Cascadia_Log.csv" to an encrypted local drive.
3. Shred all physical Clipboard forms containing PII.
