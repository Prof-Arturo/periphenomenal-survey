APS DIVISION FRANCHISE KIT: DEPLOYMENT GUIDE (v1.0)
Clearance: DIVISION DIRECTOR
Protocol: CLONE & OWN
=========================================================================

1. MISSION OVERVIEW
-------------------
You have been authorized to establish a new autonomous Division of the 
American Periphenomenal Survey (APS). This guide details how to clone 
the APS Digital Infrastructure to your own region.

OBJECTIVE: Create a secure, independent reporting node that feeds into 
your own database, while maintaining APS data standards for future 
cross-reference.

2. ASSET LIST (WHAT YOU NEED)
-----------------------------
1. A GitHub Account (Free) - Hosts your website.
2. A Google Account (Free) - Hosts your database.
3. The Source Code (Provided by APS National).

=========================================================================
PHASE 1: THE DATA SILO (GOOGLE BACKEND)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before building the website, you must build the bucket where data lands.

1. Create the Log:
   - Create a new Google Sheet.
   - Name it: "APS_[YourDivision]_Log" (e.g., APS_Appalachia_Log).
   - Create these EXACT column headers in Row 1 (Do not change spellings):
     [timestamp, age_group, gender, cultural_bg, occupation, 
      location_state, location_specific, witness_status, 
      phenom_silence, phenom_hum, phenom_time, phenom_nausea, 
      phenom_paralysis, phenom_tech, phenom_ozone, phenom_fear, 
      narrative, attribution, contact_info]

2. Install the Script:
   - In the Sheet, go to Extensions > Apps Script.
   - Delete any code there. Paste the "APS Intake Script" (Ask Cascadia 
     Director for the raw .gs code block).
   - Save the project as "APS_Intake_Backend".

3. Deploy the Receiver:
   - Click "Deploy" > "New Deployment".
   - Select type: "Web App".
   - Execute as: "Me" (Your email).
   - Who has access: "Anyone" (Critical for public reporting).
   - Click "Deploy".
   - COPY the "Web App URL". This is your KEY. Save it.

=========================================================================
PHASE 2: THE INTERFACE (GITHUB FRONTEND)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create Your HQ:
   - Login to GitHub.
   - Create a new Repository named: "aps_[your_division]" 
     (e.g., aps_appalachia).
   - Check "Add a README file".

2. Upload Assets:
   - Upload the provided 'index.html', 'privacy.html', and '/media' folder.

3. Customize the Code (The Rebrand):
   - Open 'index.html' (Click the pencil icon to edit).
   - FIND the line: const scriptURL = '...'
   - REPLACE the link with YOUR Web App URL from Phase 1.
   - FIND the <title> and <h1> tags. Change "Cascadia Division" to 
     "Appalachia Division" (or your region).
   - FIND the Bioregion Dropdown (<select id="location_state">).
     Update the options to match your local states (e.g., WV, KY, TN).
   - Commit changes.

4. Launch:
   - Go to Settings > Pages.
   - Select Branch: "main" -> Folder: "/ (root)".
   - Save. Your site is now live at: [username].github.io/aps_[division]/

=========================================================================
PHASE 3: OPERATIONAL INDEPENDENCE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* You now own the data. APS National cannot see your sheet unless you 
  share it.
* You are responsible for monitoring incoming reports.
* You are responsible for local recruitment (flyers).

STAY VIGILANT.
