APS DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL: CASCADIA (v3.1)
Status: ACTIVE | Model: Solo-Operator Node
Map Reference: aps_composite_map.png
=========================================================================

1. MISSION PROFILE
------------------
The Cascadia Unit (Region 10) operates as a decentralized archival node.
We observe Methodological Agnosticism. We document the "Data of the Weird" 
without endorsing a specific spiritual or scientific theory.

2. OPERATIONAL ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------
A. /directorate_admin/ (Project Administration)
B. /registry_data/     (The Archive - CSV Database)
C. /field_kits/        (Field Research Tools)
D. /(Root Directory)   (Public Interface)


3. PHASE 1: DIGITAL STATIONING (BETA PHASE)
--------------------------------------------------
Goal: Ensure the ingestion system works before wide release.
**Reference:** See 'APS_Technical_Launch_Guide.txt' for configuration.

[ ] STEP 1: THE INTAKE PORTAL (Geofencing Active)
    Deploy 'index.html' to GitHub Pages.
    - Constraint: Visual warnings active for non-Bioregion submissions.
    - Authorized Codes: { WA, OR, ID, BC, AK_SE, NORCAL_JEFF }
    - Logic: Non-Cascadia reports are flagged as "JURISDICTION_ERROR".

[ ] STEP 2: PROFESSIONAL VALIDATION
    - Domain: Purchase a dedicated domain (e.g., aps-cascadia.org).
    - SSL: Ensure HTTPS enforcement is active.
    - Why: A custom URL increases submission confidence by ~40%.

4. PHASE 2: DATA ACCUMULATION (ACTIVE ARCHIVE)
-----------------------------------------------------
Goal: Populate the dataset. The Public Registry remains OFFLINE (Internal Only).

[ ] STEP 1: FIELD RECRUITMENT (PASSIVE)
    Print 20 copies of "APS_Recruitment_Flyer.pdf".
    Place them in "Liminal Spaces" (ferry terminals, trailheads, community boards).

[ ] STEP 2: THE QR LINK
    Ensure the QR Code points to the Intake Portal.
    The Loop: User sees flyer -> Scans Code -> Submits Data -> Archive Ingests.

5. ANALYST WORKFLOW (WEEKLY REVIEW)
-----------------------------------
Every Sunday, the Lead Archivist assumes the role of "Senior Analyst."

[ ] STEP 1: INGESTION
    Open "APS_Cascadia_Log.csv".
    Filter by 'location_state'. Move 'OTHER' to "Transfer_Buffer".

[ ] STEP 2: CODING & CLEANING
    - Assign Case IDs (CAS-001, CAS-002...).
    - Standardize formatting.
    - Flag "High Quality" narratives for future publication.

[ ] STEP 3: ARCHIVAL
    Save the CSV.
    No public upload yet.


6. PHASE 3: THE "OPEN RECORD" (PUBLIC RELEASE)
--------------------------------------------------
**CRITICAL MILESTONE:** Initiate Phase 3 ONLY after collecting 25 Verified Reports.

[ ] STEP 1: DEPLOY 'REGISTRY.HTML'
    Create the public-facing table that pulls from your CSV.
    - Anonymize: Ensure NO names/emails are displayed.
    - Sort: Allow public to sort by "Event Type" or "Location".

[ ] STEP 2: THE FEEDBACK LOOP
    Once the Registry is live, new flyers can say:
    "See the map of local anomalies at [URL]."
    This demonstrates project activity and transparency.

7. EMERGENCY / SHUTDOWN
-----------------------
In the event of project termination:
1. Unpublish the GitHub Repository.
2. Archive "APS_Cascadia_Log.csv" to an encrypted local drive.
3. Destroy all physical Clipboard forms containing PII.
