APS DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL: CASCADIA DIVISION (v3.1)
Status: ACTIVE | Model: Solo-Operator Franchise
Map Reference: aps_composite_map.png
=========================================================================

1. MISSION PROFILE
------------------
The Cascadia Division (Region 10) operates as a decentralized archival node. 
We observe Methodological Agnosticism. We document the "Data of the Weird" 
without endorsing a specific spiritual or scientific theory.


2. OPERATIONAL ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------
A. /directorate_admin/ (Governance & Source Files)
B. /registry_data/     (The Private Archive - CSV Database)
C. /field_kits/        (Acquisition Tools)
D. /aps_online/        (Public Interface)


3. PHASE 1: DIGITAL STATIONING (THE "DARK" LAUNCH)
--------------------------------------------------
Goal: Ensure the ingestion system works before the public sees it.
**Reference:** See 'APS_Technical_Launch_Guide.txt' for step-by-step config.

[ ] STEP 1: THE INTAKE PORTAL (Geofencing Active)
...
    Deploy 'index.html' to GitHub Pages.
    - Constraint: The form must visually warn users if they select a location 
      outside the Bioregion.
    - Authorized Codes: { WA, OR, ID, BC, AK_SE, NORCAL_JEFF }
    - Logic: Non-Cascadia reports are flagged as "JURISDICTION_ERROR" in the CSV.

[ ] STEP 2: PROFESSIONAL VALIDATION
    - Domain: Purchase a dedicated domain (e.g., aps-cascadia.org).
    - SSL: Ensure HTTPS enforcement is active.
    - Why: A custom URL increases submission rates by ~40% over a raw GitHub link.


4. PHASE 2: DATA ACCUMULATION (THE "BLACKOUT" PERIOD)
-----------------------------------------------------
Goal: Fill the reservoir. The Public Registry remains OFFLINE during this phase.

[ ] STEP 1: PHYSICAL ASSETS (PASSIVE RECRUITMENT)
    Print 20 copies of "APS_Recruitment_Flyer.pdf".
    Place them in high-traffic "Liminal Spaces" (ferry terminals, trailheads, 
    bulletin boards near older forests).

[ ] STEP 2: THE QR LINK
    Ensure the QR Code points to the Intake Portal.
    The Loop: User sees flyer -> Scans Code -> Submits Data -> We Archiving.


5. ANALYST WORKFLOW (WEEKLY TRIAGE)
-----------------------------------
Every Sunday, the Director assumes the role of "Senior Analyst."

[ ] STEP 1: INGESTION
    Open "APS_Cascadia_Log.csv".
    Filter by 'location_state'. Move 'OTHER' to "Transfer_Buffer".

[ ] STEP 2: CODING & CLEANING
    - Assign Case IDs (CAS-001, CAS-002...).
    - Fix formatting errors.
    - Flag "High Quality" narratives for future publication.

[ ] STEP 3: ARCHIVAL
    Save the CSV. No public upload yet.


6. PHASE 3: THE "OPEN RECORD" (CONDITIONAL LAUNCH)
--------------------------------------------------
**CRITICAL MILESTONE:** Initiate Phase 3 ONLY after collecting 25 Verified Reports.

[ ] STEP 1: DEPLOY 'REGISTRY.HTML'
    Create the public-facing table that pulls from your CSV.
    - Sanitize: Ensure NO names/emails are displayed.
    - Sort: Allow public to sort by "Event Type" or "Location".

[ ] STEP 2: THE FEEDBACK LOOP
    Once the Registry is live, new flyers can say:
    "See the map of local anomalies at [URL]."
    This proves to the public that the project is alive and active.


7. EMERGENCY / SHUTDOWN
-----------------------
In the event of compromise or project termination:
1. Unpublish the GitHub Repository.
2. Archive "APS_Cascadia_Log.csv" to an encrypted local drive.
3. Shred all physical Clipboard forms containing PII.
