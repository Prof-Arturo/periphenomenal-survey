APS DIRECTORATE | STRATEGIC DOC 04
SUBJECT: DIVISION ACTIVATION PROTOCOL (REGIONAL EXPANSION)
CLASSIFICATION: INTERNAL USE ONLY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0 THE MANDATE FOR EXPANSION
The American Periphenomenal Survey (APS) operates on a bioregional framework. 
While the Directorate oversees Region 10 (Cascadia), high-strangeness data 
is geographically distinct. To capture the full spectrum of North American 
folklore and anomaly, we authorize the commissioning of semi-autonomous 
"Divisions" in other bioregions (e.g., Appalachia, Ozarks, Southwest).

This document outlines the protocol for vetting, provisioning, and activating 
a new Regional Division.

2.0 THE "FRANCHISE" MODEL (FEDERATED DATA)
We do not manage remote field teams. We commission "Regional Directors."
A Regional Director is granted a license to use the APS branding, 
methodology, and digital infrastructure in exchange for data standardization.

    [ THE DEAL ]
    > DIRECTORATE PROVIDES:   Brand Legitimacy, Digital Templates, Field Manuals.
    > DIVISION PROVIDES:      Local Labor, Hosting Costs (Free via Google), Data Access.

3.0 ACTIVATION PHASES

    PHASE I: VETTING (The Application)
    ----------------------------------
    Prospective Directors must submit a "Letter of Intent" to the Directorate.
    They must demonstrate:
    A) Academic Detachment (Methodological Agnosticism).
    B) Technical Competence (Ability to manage a Google Sheet/Script).
    C) Bioregional Knowledge (Define their specific territory).

    *CRITICAL:* We strictly reject "Ghost Hunting" groups seeking validation. 
    The APS is an archival body, not a paranormal investigation team.

    PHASE II: PROVISIONING (The Kit)
    --------------------------------
    Once approved, the Division receives the "Deployment Archive":
    
    1. DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE:
       - The GitHub Repository (Cloned Website).
       - The Google Sheet Template (Pre-formatted Headers).
       - The Apps Script Code (customized with their Region Code, e.g., APP-).
    
    2. PRINT ASSETS (Editable PDFs):
       - Field Manual (Region Code updated).
       - ID Cards / Business Cards.
       - QR Stickers (Customized URL).

    3. BRANDING:
       - A localized Logo Seal (e.g., "APPALACHIA DIVISION" with local flora/fauna).
         *Note: Directorate creates the logo to ensure brand consistency.*

    PHASE III: INITIALIZATION
    -------------------------
    1. The Division launches their local interface (e.g., aps-appalachia.org or subdomain).
    2. They conduct a "Dry Run" (5 test entries).
    3. They grant the Directorate "Viewer" access to their Master Log.

4.0 OPERATIONAL STANDARDS (THE CHARTER)

    [1] DATA SOVEREIGNTY
    Each Division owns their data. They are responsible for privacy scrubbing.
    However, the Directorate retains the right to aggregate anonymized 
    narratives for the "National Index."

    [2] UNIFORMITY OF METHOD
    Divisions must use the Standard Typology (Type I-V) and the standard 
    checkboxes. Custom fields require Directorate approval to prevent 
    database fragmentation.

    [3] BRAND PROTECTION
    Divisions may NOT use the APS name to sell merchandise, solicit donations 
    for profit, or endorse political/religious stances. 
    Violation results in immediate "Decommissioning" (URL revocation).

5.0 REGION CODES (NOMENCLATURE)
    New Divisions are assigned a 3-letter prefix for their Case IDs.

    REGION 10: Cascadia       [CAS-XXXX] (Active)
    REGION 01: New England    [NEG-XXXX]
    REGION 03: Appalachia     [APP-XXXX]
    REGION 06: Great Lakes    [LKS-XXXX]
    REGION 08: Southwest      [DSW-XXXX]

6.0 EXIT PROTOCOL
    If a Regional Director resigns, they must either:
    A) Transfer ownership of the Google Sheet/Domain to a successor.
    B) Export all CSV data to the Directorate before deletion.
