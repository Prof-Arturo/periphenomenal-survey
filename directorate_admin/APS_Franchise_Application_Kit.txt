SECTION 2.0: INTERVIEW PROTOCOL (VETTING SCRIPT)
[INSTRUCTION]: Use this script during the Voice/Video interview to assess
candidate suitability for Division Leadership.

    2.1 PHASE I: THE "VIBE CHECK" (CULTURAL ALIGNMENT)
    --------------------------------------------------
    GOAL: Determine if candidate shares the "Design Language" and ethical
    framework. We protect the brand tone to ensure high-quality data.

    Q1: "Tell me about your favorite local legend or 'High Strangeness' 
        location. Not the famous one, but the weird one."
        > TARGET: Niche knowledge, folklore passion.
        > RED FLAG: "Ghost Adventures" fandom or reality TV style.

    Q2: "This project is 90% spreadsheets and reading emails. Are you 
        prepared for the administrative load, or are you seeking field action?"
        > TARGET: Appreciation for data hygiene.
        > RED FLAG: Desire for "hunting" or thrill-seeking.

    2.2 PHASE II: THE STRESS TEST (SAFETY & ETHICS)
    -----------------------------------------------
    GOAL: Ensure candidate will not engage in dangerous roleplay.

    Q3: "A user submits a report saying they are currently being stalked 
        by an entity and are terrified. They ask for help. Action?"
        > PASS: Refer to mental health resources/police. Archive data.
        > FAIL: Offer "protection," spiritual cleansing, or investigation.

    Q4: "Someone accuses the project of being a LARP on a local forum. 
        How do you respond?"
        > PASS: "We do not confirm or deny. We document stories."
        > FAIL: Arguing, trying to prove reality, or breaking character.

    2.3 PHASE III: THE TECHNICAL AUDIT
    ----------------------------------
    GOAL: Assess maintenance load.

    Q5: "Are you comfortable forking a GitHub repo and hosting via Pages?"
        > PASS: Self-sufficient.
        > PROBATION: Needs Directorate to host (Higher Admin Load).

    2.4 DECISION MATRIX
    -------------------
    [ ] APPROVE:   Candidate understands Agnosticism + Has Tech Skills.
                   ACTION: Issue Region Code (e.g., APP-). Send Kit.

    [ ] PROBATION: Passionate but non-technical.
                   ACTION: Grant "Field Researcher" status only.

    [ ] REJECT:    Wants to hunt ghosts, monetize, or evangelize.
                   ACTION: Standard Rejection Letter (Form DIR-09).
