SECTION 2.0: INTERVIEW PROTOCOL (VETTING SCRIPT)
[INSTRUCTION]: Use this script to assess candidate suitability for Chapter Leadership.

2.1 PHASE I: CULTURAL ALIGNMENT
    --------------------------------------------------
    GOAL: Determine if candidate shares the "Design Language" and ethical framework.

    Q1: "Tell me about your favorite local legend or 'High Strangeness' 
        location. Not the famous one, but the weird one."
        > TARGET: Niche knowledge, folklore passion.
        > RED FLAG: "Ghost Adventures" fandom or reality TV style.

    Q2: "This project is 90% spreadsheets and reading emails. Are you 
        prepared for the administrative load?"
        > TARGET: Appreciation for data hygiene.
        > RED FLAG: Desire for "hunting" or thrill-seeking.

2.2 PHASE II: ETHICS & SAFETY
    -----------------------------------------------
    GOAL: Ensure candidate will not engage in dangerous roleplay.

    Q3: "A user submits a report saying they are currently being stalked 
        by an entity and are terrified. They ask for help. Action?"
        > PASS: Refer to mental health resources/police. Archive data only.
        > FAIL: Offer "protection," spiritual cleansing, or investigation.

    Q4: "Someone accuses the project of being a game on a local forum. 
        How do you respond?"
        > PASS: "We are an art/research collective documenting folklore."
        > FAIL: Arguing, trying to prove reality, or breaking character.

2.3 PHASE III: TECHNICAL AUDIT
    ----------------------------------
    GOAL: Assess maintenance load.

    Q5: "Are you comfortable forking a GitHub repo and hosting via Pages?"
        > PASS: Self-sufficient.
        > PROBATION: Needs Admin to host (Higher Load).

    2.4 DECISION MATRIX
    -------------------
    [ ] APPROVE:   Candidate understands Agnosticism + Has Tech Skills.
                   ACTION: Issue Region Code (e.g., APP-). Send Kit.

    [ ] PROBATION: Passionate but non-technical.
                   ACTION: Grant "Field Researcher" status only.

    [ ] REJECT:    Wants to hunt ghosts, monetize, or evangelize.
                   ACTION: Standard Rejection Letter.
