1/4/2026 0:39:36,CASE-47528,26-35,Female,WA,Atheist,Physical Therapy,,,,,,,WITNESS_1,,,,,,,,,"March 24th, 2023 - I visited The Brick Saloon with a group of ~10 other women as part of a bachelorette weekend. It was in the evening around 7-8pm, one half of the building was the original bar area and the other was a stage with live band playing and dancefloor. One of the employees asked if we wanted to see the basement which was the former jail for the town, we agreed and they brought us downstairs. It was open to the entire floorplan of the main building, with a few gated cells on the nearest side and foundation pilings throughout the rest. It was pretty much a giant supply room, mostly cleaning and barware but more thrifty/antique items toward the rear of the building. The employee mentioned hearing laughter sometimes when he was downstairs alone, I was a little curious so myself and another girl went further back away from the rest of the group to explore.

She and I split up towards the back of the large room. I turned a corner around a foundation footing and saw what looked like a rectangular mirror leaning against the wall to my right. It was about 6x3 ft similar to a dressing room door mirror. As I walked forward I turned towards it to see my reflection, but it only showed the wall opposite me. I was a little panicked and surprised, so I called for my friend who had followed me away from the group. When she stepped in front of it she also did not appear. We waved our arms, changed angles, nothing. Finally, I reached out to touch it and felt nothing but air. It was an opening in the foundation footing that looked like a mirror image of the opposite side, and something about it gave the appearance of a tall narrow mirror leaning against a wall somehow.

Since it was with a bachelorette group at a bar, I feel that I should add that it was our first stop of the night on a Friday evening. I had 2 light beers as a quick ""pregame"" at the rental house after arriving from Seattle, before our drive from Suncadia (Cle Elum) to Roslyn. I also VERY regularly smoke and vape cannabis so that was involved as well. None of this is out of the ordinary for me by any means (basically any given Tuesday) and I am very confident in saying that it had little to no effect on my experience. Especially given that it was a shared experience, and had been my only paranormal experience at the time. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other than referring to it as my ""phantom mirror"" experience, I really don't have any solid theories. The building itself was established in 1889 and is said to be Washington's oldest continuously operating bar (as per their website). Some sources mention a tunnel in the basement used to move alcohol during Prohibition. Only one of the cells are original, and a couple others were added to film ""The Runner Stumbles"" in 1979. The bar was also featured in the show Northern Exposure. Roslyn was historically a coal mining and logging town, so the jail in the basement likely saw quite a few people in its life. All that to say, the building itself is notable for many reasons but not for any that I could use to explain a ""phantom mirror"".",katieb.50@gmail.com,PUBLISH_ANON,PENDING,,"The Brick Saloon in Roslyn WA, basement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We did not know the actual location so we had to still locate it. I had a crew above in a tug boat monitoring me, and I was in the water, about 120 feet underwater. I was walking on the bottom of the lake, and it was pitch black but I had a flashlight. Everything was unremarkable until I felt a swoosh past, like a big movement of water, it even made me stumble. My heart started beating fast because I felt a sudden fear knowing that nothing should be able to move that big in Lake Washington. I kept walking and looking with my flashlight then I saw giant fish scales, white and orange. It was a giant koi fish. I followed it with my flashlight and it had to have been the size of a Mini Cooper, it swam in and out of the range of my flashlight for a little while and when my fear finally subsided and I was able to move, I swam up to get out of the water.

We heard someone yell for help. We sat silently for a few seconds before we all heard it again. It was coming very clearly from the direction of one of the other plots. I grabbed a flashlight and 3 of us went to go down the path to check out the other lot. we ran into a group of 2 people from another camp who heard the same thing that were also on their way. No one heard another sound on the way there. when we arrived at the lot we heard it from it was empty - no signs of anyone at all. We looked around and behind the camp but it was just dense forest in every direction. the campground was a circle so behind this lot there weren't any other camps, it had to be from here. After a while of poking around confused and scared everyone went back to camp and tried to sleep. We talked to a park ranger driving around the campground next morning and asked if anything happened. They hadn't heard anything, and everyone at all the campsites were accounted for. No one knew who it was, or if it was even a person.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"I had flatly refused to attribute it to the supernatural as a matter of course, but it always felt like we came very close to something too strange.",,PUBLISH_ANON,PENDING,,"Unknown lake, chelan county?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suddenly all traffic sounds stopped and I could only hear a low hum coming from under a bridge. I stopped to look at where the noise was coming from for a moment and as I did, I became incredibly nauseated. After about 30 seconds, a group of crows cawed loudly and flew out in my direction and all the noise of the city unpaused itself. My watch said it was now 4:23pm.

I got out to check on the engine, of my 2024 Ford Super Duty Limited, with a jacked chassis. I then smelled rotten eggs. I thought this was odd because I had just taken a shower last week, and I do not start to smell like eggs ‘til at least three weeks after. I then looked around to find the source of the pungent stank; I believed it was a ran over skunk. As I was taking a gander I heard the beating of wings, I looked up to see if it was some birds but to my surprise it was a humanoid figure with wings spanning at least 50 feet. Its face was reminiscent of a flying fox bat, reminds me of my aunt [REDACTED] 😂, at least from what I could tell. Its eye glowed a sickeningly blood red and its coat shone a navy blue. It hovered for a moment as it seemed to stare into my soul. I then ran back into the safety of my 2024 Ford Super Duty Limited, with a jacked chassis. As I waited for the beast to fly away I felt a pulsing pressure in my frontal lobe, and a tickling sensation in my left cheek, not saying which cheek haha. The beast then flew away, I assume it no longer saw me as an easy target, possibly because of my 2024 Ford Super Duty Limited, with a jacked chassis. I don’t exactly remember anything after that because I was in shock, I had never come across something like this in all 69 of my years, might I add that these years were spent as a red blooded Catholic American.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have since done some research on this topic before I ran into the flyer for this fine institution. I have come to the conclusion, with the help of my Reddit friends, that this was the elusive, notoriously infamous, batsquatch.

So I do believe wholeheartedly that the batsquatch is back.",,PRIVATE_DATA,SPAM,,Shoreline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
